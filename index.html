            <h2>Dear diary,</h2>
            <p> Today is a big day!<br>
                I got the opportunity to travel to this deserted island two days earlier than planned and ofcourse I
                took
                it!<br>
                I finished everything I had to do during the day before I left.<br>
                Even thought it was already evening before I finished, but that didn't stop me.<br><br>

                When I arrived, I was greeted by this Tanuki named Tom Nook and his two nephews Timmy and Tommy. I got
                to meet Paula and Kid Cat as well! One of the nephews gave me a tent to set up and when I was done, I
                helped Paula and Kid Cat with theirs!<br>
                Did I mentioned that the island is full of cherries?? I couldn't think of any other name for the island
                than 'Cherryton', everyone agreed with me and that is how this deserted island will go by the name
                'Cherryton' from now on.<br><br>

                Before I went to sleep Tom Nook gave me a map of the whole island.<br><br>

            <h2>Dear diary,</h2>
            <p>When I woke up I was a little bit dissoriented, I lowkey forgot that I was nog at home anymore.<br>
                But I wasn't sad when I realised out that I am on a deserted island. Well, I can't call it deserted
                anymore, since we are with sixth here!<br>
                I went outside and greeted everyone. Kid Cat gave me a nice new Safari hat as well! I decided to wear it
                immediatly.<br><br>

                Later the day I learned to make some handy tools! I can catch bugs, fish and I can even dig up some
                fossils!<br>
                Oh that reminds me! Tom Nook knows this friend names Blathers and he can analyse these fossils.<br>
                I also learned how to make an axe, so I can chop some wood. Unfortunately, the tools are breakable.

            <h2>Dear diary,</h2>
            <p>Today is the big day! Is what I would have said, if I didn't got the opportunity leave home two days
                ago.<br>
                To celebrate this day, I decides to get a haircut! My hair so shorter! I love it.<br>
                But what I don't love are these tarantulas! There are so many tarantulas at night!<br>
                I managed to catch one, I will give this one to Blathers... But when I left the museum, another
                tarantula decides to chase me! I never panicked this much in my whole life!<br>
                I ran across the whole island! The tarantula didn't gave up.. I tried to catch it, but when I went to
                grab my net, the tarantula got me...<br><br>

                I don't remember how I got here, but I woke up at the front of my house.
